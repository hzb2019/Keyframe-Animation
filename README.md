#Animation Program

This is the final project of our CSE 335 Object Oriented Software Development course.

This was intended to showcase our understanding of techniques used to simplify the organization of rather complicated code systems, and display our ability to implement code based
on pre-planned designs.

We worked on developing the "CanadianExperienceLib" library in the assignments leading up to the final project. For this project, that library was given to us as starter code to 
make sure we could properly write the library "MachineLib" which is the code to set up an animated machine whose parts interact with one another. All classes in MachineLib were 
written by me, save for three that were provided and are accordingly attributed otherwise. 

Developed in CLion with toolchain settings set to a Visual Studio environment, amd64 architecture and the bundled LLDB debugger.
